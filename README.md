# Refactoring with connascence handson checkout

After listening to the very interesting and inspiring [talk of Thorsten Brunzendorf "Refactoring mit Connascence"](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/swkthde/events/258066802/) an handson part of about an hour started.

The code of this repository was produced in this handson part for the coding kata [Kata09: Back to the Checkout](http://codekata.com/kata/kata09-back-to-the-checkout/). The code was developed strictly following the [TDD algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).
